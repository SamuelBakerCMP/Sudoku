## About The Project

* Sudoku was the second app created using android studio, after TicTacToe
* The code allows a user to play the game Sudoku.
* The sudoku is read in from an external file 'sudoku.txt'. Currently this contains only a singular puzzle, however the code can be adapted to accomodate for multiple puzzles
* Logic has been implemented to identify whether there is a repeat number either horizontally, vertically, or in the 3*3 grid the number is inside of.
* The code also checks if the player has won.
* A SAVE/LOAD feature was also created, but must be altered.
